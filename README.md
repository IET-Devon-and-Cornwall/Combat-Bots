# Combat Bots
Welcome to the IET Devon and Cornwall Repository for the Combat Bots Touranment.

In the early 2000s, the BBC hosted a cult children’s television series Robot Wars. The premise of the show was to have robots – designed by amateur and professional roboteers – fight to the death!

As you can imagine, it was an *instant hit*.

Almost 20 years later, established at the University of Plymouth by [Jake Shaw Sutton](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/jake-shaw-sutton) in 2019, Combat Bots is an extra curricular activity provided for undergradate and apprentice engineers in the Devon and Cornwall region.

The University of Plymouth currently have their own well established league, and **are inviting challengers from industry and other universities and colleges!**

This repository will provide your Unversity, College, Team or yourself as an individual everything you need to get involved!

There are several different weight categories which fight in the UK, across universities and colleges:
- Heavyweight: 100kg
- Featherweight: 13.6Kg
- Beetleweight: 1.5kg
- **Antweight: 150g <- Combat Bots Category**
- Fleaweight: 75g
- Nanoweight: 25g

The University of Plymouth invite challengers in the 150g category, the rules of which from a size, weight and power (SWaP) perspective are well documented in the hardware folder of this repo.

This GitHub repository will provide you with everything you need to get started, whether you're an apprentice at a college, student at a university, employee of an engineering company or a hobbyist who wants to challenge themselves!
