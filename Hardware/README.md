# Hardware Rules and Guidance

These rules are based off of the Antweight rules published on the [robotwars101.org website](https://www.robotwars101.org/ants/rules.htm). They have been re-written here for safe keeping and continuity.

## Definitions
Roller – A robot using wheels or similar full rotation capable component contacting the arena to move.

Non-Roller – Any robot not fitting the Roller definition including Shufflers, Walkers and Hovercrafts.

Flyer – Any robot that moves through self sustained flight. This type of robot is not allowed.

Clusterbot – A robot which consists of two or more parts (e.g. two half sized robots/botlets)

Arena – The area robots are intended to fight in. A fully enclosed safety cover surrounds the arena.

Pit or Dropoff – Gaps or spaces in the arena floor, normally at the edges, that a robot may fall into.

## Size Limits

Robots must fit completely inside a 4 inch (101.6mm) cube. it does not have to sit flat on the floor of the cube.

Robots may only expand from their size limit once a fight has begun, and only if the expansion is instigated by remote control (i.e. not just by being springy). If a robot in a clusters expanding is triggered by another cluster part they must start the fight how they fit together in the cube.

## Control
Robots must have an externally accessible way of being shut down (e.g. a power switch, removable link or battery plug) that can be operated without tools. 

## RF Spectrum
Radios may use the following frequencies: 27 MHz, 40 MHz, 418 MHz, 433-434 MHz, 868 MHz and 2.45 GHz. All Radios must comply with all relevant rules and regulations.

## Weapons
For safety purposes, all weaponry must have the capability of being deactivated by remote control.

The following weapon types are not permitted:

- Glue or sticky pad weapons
- Fluid based weapons (treacle guns, etc.)
- String or entanglement weapons
- Flame based weapons
- The use of electricity as a weapon
- Explosive weapons
- Rotating weapons that may shatter (as opposed to - breaking off)
- Magnetic/inductive systems
- Any system involving the use of pressurised gas or - liquid is limited to 100 p.s.i. (7 Bar).

Weapons are not permitted to deliberately detach completely from the robot, but may be partially separated as long as it is connected by a tether of no more than 3 feet (914mm). The tether may not be used as an entanglement weapon.

All sharp edges must have protective covers outside the arena. All protective covers are to be made clearly visible.

## Failsafe
The robot shall cease all motion when the controlling transmitter is switched off.

## Batteries 
Batteries must not contain liquid acid, or electrolyte, or exceed a maximum of 24 volts.
