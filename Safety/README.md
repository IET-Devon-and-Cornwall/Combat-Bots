# Safety Rules and Guidance

These rules are based off of the Antweight rules published on the [robotwars101.org website](https://www.robotwars101.org/ants/rules.htm). They have been re-written here for safe keeping and continuity.

## Definitions
Roller – A robot using wheels or similar full rotation capable component contacting the arena to move.

Non-Roller – Any robot not fitting the Roller definition including Shufflers, Walkers and Hovercrafts.

Flyer – Any robot that moves through self sustained flight. This type of robot is not allowed.

Clusterbot – A robot which consists of two or more parts (e.g. two half sized robots/botlets)

Arena – The area robots are intended to fight in. A fully enclosed safety cover surrounds the arena.

Pit or Dropoff – Gaps or spaces in the arena floor, normally at the edges, that a robot may fall into.

## Arena Rules

All battles must take place in an arena, regardless of weapons being used in the battle. Arena doors must be closed before any fight begins, regardless of weapon type.

An arenas safety enclosure must fully enclose the arena during fights. **4mm polycarbonate is the minimum recommended thickness for an arena safety enclosure**. Small sacrificial kick plates are recommended where the arena fighting surface and external walls meet.

The arena will be a raised platform with a recommended area of at least 30 inches (762mm) square.

It is recommended that at least 25% of the edge of the arena must be un-walled, to allow robots to drop directly into the pit or dropoff that surrounds the arena.

he minimum recommended gap in the arena floor for pits and dropoffs is 140mm.

## Safe Operation
Contestants must obey the event organiser at all times, or be disqualified. Event organisers have final say on any issues raised at an event.

There shall be 3 neutral judges identified before each battle. If a contestant has an objection to one or more of the judges then they shall make it clear before the match begins. The event organisers will then decide if the complaint is valid.

Before competition commences, each robot will be checked by the event organisers to ensure that a minimum of the following rules are complied with before being allowed to compete: weight, size, power link/switch, failsafe, sharp edges.

All teams must be self-contained in terms of driver, transmitter, robots and battery packs, i.e. these cannot be shared with another team. Clusterbots may use additional drivers from other teams but must comply with all other parts of this rule.

Robots should only be handled by the robots’ team or event organisers. It is the drivers responsibility to ensure their robot is safe and all weapons are inactive before retrieval.

A robot must be placed in the arena when called to fight within five minutes of being called by the event organiser (this is a maximum limit, contestants are encouraged to be ready to fight as soon as possible). Robots failing to be ready within this time may be judged to have lost the fight.

**Lipos must be charged in LiPo bags or a similarly suitable container. They must not be left unattended while charging**

Robots must only be operated inside the arena or normal testing for functionality on a bench. Spinning or otherwise dangerous weaponry may not be used at all outside of an arena with the doors closed.

Non-combatants must not touch the arena and keep back from it during battles.

A LiPo bag or similarly suitable container must be readily available by the arena during each fight.

A team may enter a maximum of four robots of which three may be Rollers and one Non-Roller or Cluster (Where robot numbers require limiting it is recommended that the number of Rollers a team may enter is reduced first over Non-Rollers or Clusters).
