# Combat Rules and Guidance

These rules are based off of the Antweight rules published on the [robotwars101.org website](https://www.robotwars101.org/ants/rules.htm). They have been re-written here for safe keeping and continuity.

## Definitions
Roller – A robot using wheels or similar full rotation capable component contacting the arena to move.

Non-Roller – Any robot not fitting the Roller definition including Shufflers, Walkers and Hovercrafts.

Flyer – Any robot that moves through self sustained flight. This type of robot is not allowed.

Clusterbot – A robot which consists of two or more parts (e.g. two half sized robots/botlets)

Arena – The area robots are intended to fight in. A fully enclosed safety cover surrounds the arena.

Pit or Dropoff – Gaps or spaces in the arena floor, normally at the edges, that a robot may fall into.

## Combat Rules
Battles will last for a maximum of three minutes. The judges will decide the winner of any battle that has not ended after the time limit.

A robot that falls off the arena and touches the bottom of the pit or dropoff has lost. If a robot bounces into and out of the pit or dropoff without touching the bottom (Or robot that has lost within the pit or dropoff) the fight may continue.

When any robot is immobile or lacks controlled motion then a judge will start a 10 second count down after which the robot will have lost if it is unable to restore controlled motion. Contact between an immobile robot and an opponent will reset the count. If a robot is counted out the immobilisation is retrospectively considered to have applied at the start of the count (For cases where a robot may leave the arena while their opponent is being counted out).

At any time in a fight, a robot may surrender, if so they will have lost (The roboteer may clearly shout stop).

Robots may hold or pin each other for a maximum of 20 seconds. The judge will give a verbal warning for the contestants to disengage. If they are unable to do so the battle will be paused and the robots separated where they are. The battle will then recommence immediately.

Outside manipulation is not permitted during the contest (they may be manipulated by a judge during a pause in the battle, as described in the previous rule).

A Clusterbot will have lost when all of its botlets have been eliminated

If a robot leaves the arena after the battle has started but before the robots have made contact the battle is to be restarted. A maximum of 2 restarts is allowed per robot.

The Aggressor Rule – If two robots fall into a pit or dropoff at the same time ending the fight, where one bot can be clearly identified as the aggressor to this action, the aggressor is judged to have won. Otherwise consider under rule 4j. Normally this occurs where one robot is pushing the other, reactions from spinning weaponry hits are not considered under 4i.

If opposing robots have left the arena simultaneously (and cannot be decided under rule 4i) then the fight will be paused, the robots involved placed immediately back in their start positions (Without repairs) and the fight restarted. If a robot is unable to continue it will be judged to have lost, if both robots are unable to continue the judges will decide the winner.

Common Sense Winner – If a robot damages another robot, rendering it completely incapable of continuing to fight in any manner (Such as loss of power or no method of any movement), but the damaging robot falls into a pit or dropoff as a result of the attack, as long as the damaging robot is capable of continuing to fight, then the judges may award the damaging robot the win at their discretion.
